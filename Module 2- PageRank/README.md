## Analysis of Large Graphs
* Web can be represented as a directed graph with web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges.
* In order to determine the importance of web pages, we can rank the nodes.
* The idea is that some pages will have lots of edges pointing to it. So they may have high importance.

#### Link Analysis Algorithms (approaches to compute importance of nodes in a graph):
* Page Rank
* Hubs and Authorities (HITS)
* Topic-Specific (Personalized) Page Rank
* Web Spam Detection Algorithms
